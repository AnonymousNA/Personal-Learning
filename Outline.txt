Steps to complete W+B
 1. Define static variables
       - Max gross weight
       - Basic empty weight
       - Datum plane is set to 0in
       - Fuel tank size and arm
       - passenger seats (edit to allow for different configs)
       - Max loading for all stations
 2. Get inputs
       - Fuel type (avgas = 6 lbs/gal)
       - Cargo areas load
       - Any ballast
 3. Compute the moments
 4. Check if total moments and weight is within the envelope
       - Here is a digitized version of the W+B envelope

For now, we will isolate the static attributes of an aircraft to a separate build file.
